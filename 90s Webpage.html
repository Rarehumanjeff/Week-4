   The Music Scene:
   <br>
   Perhaps the biggest change music over the decade was in Grunge: the sound of flannel shirts, 
   existential angst, and guitars that sound like they're being played through a blender. Hailing 
   from Seattle, the land of perpetual drizzle, it's a genre that perfectly captures the feeling of 
   being perpetually unimpressed with everything.
